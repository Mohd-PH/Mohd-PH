>These are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they are not original with me,
<br/>If they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing, or next to nothing,
<br/>If they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they are nothing,
<br/>If they are not just as close as they are distant they are nothing.
<br/>This is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the water is,
<br/>This the common air that bathes the globe.
